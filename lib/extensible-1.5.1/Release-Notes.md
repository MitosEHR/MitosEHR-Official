# Extensible 1.5.x Release Notes

These notes apply to the Ext 4.x branch of Extensible.

## 1.5.1

_February 6, 2012_

**New Features**

* Added Extensible-config.js for easier example path configuration (they now work out of the box by default)

**Bugs Fixed**

* Lots of fixes due to changes in the upcoming Ext 4.1 release
    - Fixed Ext.data.Reader override due to internal refactoring that broke the override
    - The XTemplate rendering process changed, forcing adjustments to all of the calendar templates
    - Ext.dd.StatusProxy now extends Component, so the Extensible subclass had to be updated also
    - Fixed field anchoring in the event form
    - Refactored the DateRange field -- the old version did not work under the new layout changes
    - Fixed a bug that broke the positioning of the CalendarCombo icon
    - Form CSS tweaks
    - Fixed how the CalendarPanel's toolbar items are initialized
    - Fixed FF-only positioning bug in CalendarCombo introduced by field layout switch to tables as wrappers
* Default all views to `hideMode: offsets` to preserve scroll position cross-browser
* Fixed logic that sets the active view and navigation state on initial load
* Refactored event rendering in month view to fix issues with some complex overlapping scenarios
* Fixed issue with duplicate remote loads when switching views
* Fixed potential null error in MemoryEventStore
* Fixed an edge case that could cause certain events not to show up in the Day view header
* Added null check to avoid errors when calculating the event rendering grid if the maxEvents array is empty
* Fix calendar start date not getting set correctly in some cases
* Added safety checks around all Ext overrides to avoid errors if any classes are not present
* Fixed EventWindow animateTarget not working
* Fixed calendar to fire `eventclick` always, even when the calendar is read-only
* Fixed IE9-specific scroll reset on click bug

## 1.5.0

_October 14, 2011_

**New Features**

* Added Italian locale
* Added `Extensible.form.field.DateRange.timeFormat` config
* Added `Extensible.Date` utility methods: `isMidnight()`, `isToday()`, and `today()`

**Bugs Fixed**

* Refactored `Extensible.Date.add` to fix daylight savings-related bugs
* Fixed Ext JS CSS class prefixes that were renamed `.ext-` to `.x-` in Ext 4
* Fixed scrollbar width offset bug introduced by OSX Lion's new scrollbars
* DateRange field `singleLine` config honored properly again
* Added AbstractCard.renderChildren override to work around an Ext card layout bug
* Fixed error with sample data file name case-sensitivity
* Fix to ensure that CalendarPanel fires the `viewchange` event after initial render
* Fix CalendarPanel title updating correctly in the TestApp sample
* German locale updates
* Fixed drag-to-create not working in AbstractCalendar
* Fix MonthDetailView to properly honor the `enableContextMenu` config
* Fix toolbar hiding/showing when switching to detailed edit form
* Fix calendar colors for IE/Opera
* Fixed calendar render bug when resizing an event to end at midnight
* Patched an Ext bug related to component ids when no explicit id assigned to a CalendarPanel
* Fixed view end date getting modified incorrectly by event handlers
* Change to enforce exact, case-sensitive matching on event ids during selection
* Added `constrain: true` as a default config for EventWindow
* Added a `destroy` method to the DropZone to fix dd shims not working in some cases
* Fixed `Ext.data.MemoryProxy` override to commit in-memory records after save to avoid rejecting previous changes on cancel
* Fixed view boundary bug related to setting a static start date on views with &lt; 7 days
* Fixed off-by-one pixel issues with aligning events in the day/week views in various browsers

**Known Issues**

* The dd.ScrollManager seems to have some serious issues in 4.x at the moment, and so support for automatic container scrolling during drag in the calendar day/week views has been temporarily removed. It will be reinstated in a future release once this is resolved.

## 1.5.0 (Beta)

_June 23, 2011_

This release is strictly for implementing Ext 4 support in the calendar components. It includes all the changes from 1.0.1 (ported to Ext 4 if needed), but no new features were implemented or bugs fixed outside of the 1.0.x branch that weren't specific to Ext 4. Going forward the master (1.5+) branch of Extensible will maintain Ext 4 support, and the 1.x branch of Extensible will remain on Ext 3.x.

**API Changes**

* Every single class in Extensible has been renamed and/or re-namespaced, both for consistency with Ext 4 conventions and also to improve overall organization. While this is a breaking change, there is a compatibility file (`extensible-1.0-compat.js`) that should make this seamless. While you should definitely rename the Extensible references in your app code long-term, you should be able to run with the compat file loaded with no other changes (though you'll likely need to make other changes in general to support Ext 4 if you are porting existing Ext 3.x app code).
* Unfortunately the Ext 4 server proxies now send a `start` param by default with all requests, which overrides the start date value sent by the calendar since it was using the same default param name. Because of this `CalendarView.dateParamStart` now defaults to `startDate` (and `CalendarView.dateParamEnd` defaults to `endDate` for consistency). Server code that evaluates either of these params will have to be updated accordingly.

**Known issues**

* The DateTime picker currently only supports single-line (non-stacked) configuration, and may get cut off in fixed-width containers. This will be fixed in the next release.
* IE has a mysterious black border around all-day and spanning events
* The Extensible API documentation has not yet been updated to reflect all the changes in this release


---

The 1.0.x releases below were based on Ext 3.x. After the 1.0.1 release Extensible was branched to 1.5.x for Ext 4 support. The Extensible 1.0.x release notes are now maintained in the [1.0.x branch](https://github.com/bmoeskau/Extensible/tree/1.x) only going forward, but these notes are kept here for historical purposes.

## 1.0 (RC 1)

_Jan. 26, 2011_

**New Features**

* Lots of new options to customize the time increments and boundaries that can be shown (`showHourSeparator`, `viewStartHour`, `viewEndHour`, `scrollStartHour`, `hourHeight`, `ddIncrement`, `minEventDisplayMinutes`). This enables highly customizable calendar layouts, as shown in the new sample custom-views.html.
* New option `enableEditDetails` to hide/show the "edit details" link on the edit window
* New sample doc-types.php for easily testing various HTML doctype combinations
* Catalan and Spanish (Spain) locale files

**Bugs Fixed**

* "More events" popup window should exclude events from hidden calendars
* `CalendarList.radioCalendar` causes many unnecessary store.load calls
* Event store reloaded improperly when `view.refresh` is passed as a callback function
* String calendar ids should be allowed
* End date boundary bug in `isEventVisible`
* Revised event overlap logic for day/week views to support minimum event display height
* WeekView sometimes stays on the same week when moving forward/back using the arrow buttons

## 1.0 (Beta 2)

**New Features**

* Added CalendarView.getEventClass for customizing events at render time (works like GridView.getRowClass)
* Added Swedish, Portuguese (Portugal) and Portuguese (Brazil) locales
* Added Windows .bat build script

## 1.0 (Beta 1)

_Dec. 9, 2010_

**API Changes**

* The default value for `CalendarView.dateParamFormat` is now 'Y-m-d' (instead of 'm-d-Y'). This was done for consistency and also because it is a more sensible default. If you are currently using the default format and handling it on your server you may need to either set this config to the old value or change the date format expected on the back end to match 'Y-m-d'.

**New Features**

* Full localization support + new sample with 4 locales
