phpDocumentor Installation instructions
---------------------------------------

phpDocumentor is very easy to install.  The hardest part is installing PHP
and possibly a Web Server, if you plan to use the web interface phpdoc.php.

To install phpDocumentor, use a compression program to decompress the
contents to a directory, preserving internal directory structure of the
archive.  If you wish to use the web interface, you must unzip the
archive into a subdirectory accessible by the web server.

NOTE:
There have been problems with the non GNU tar not being able to extracts some
of the long directory paths properly.  The simplest solution for BSD users is
to download the zip version of phpDocumentor.

PEAR installation
-----------------
This is by far the easiest way to install phpDocumentor.  Included in this
release is a package.xml file.

If you plan to use the web interface, you must run this command prior to installation:

pear config-set data_dir /path/to/public_html/pear

The line above assumes that /path/to/public_html is the location of index.html if you browse
to http://localhost/index.html

To install or upgrade phpDocumentor, simply run

pear upgrade PhpDocumentor

To use the web interface, browse to http://localhost/pear/PhpDocumentor/index.html

The cli interface is installed in the pear bin_dir, you can find this directory by running:
pear config-show

Command-line interface installation and usage instructions
----------------------------------------------------------
To use phpDocumentor as a command-line interface, you need to install PHP
version 4.1.0 or greater.

*IMPORTANT* any version of PHP below 4.1.0 will not work with version 1.3.0 or later of
phpDocumentor!!!  To use the advanced tokenizer-based parser, you must have php 4.3.0

Windows
-------
You need the cli version of PHP (php-cli.exe or cli/php.exe in 4.3.0+).
Either run phpDocumentor from the directory that PHP resides in, or put
php.exe in your DOS PATH enviroment variable.  The simplest usage of phpDocumentor is:

C:\>php.exe "C:\Path\To\phpdoc" -t targetdir -o HTML:default:default -d parsedir

where targetdir is the directory you wish phpDocumentor to create output,
and parsedir is the directory you wish to parse.

Unix
----
Make sure that the cgi/cli version of PHP is in your path.  The simplest usage
of phpDocumentor is:

phpdoc -t targetdir -o HTML:default:default -d parsedir

You can also use makedoc.sh. Simply copy it to your project path and edit it.
When you wish to (re)build your project's documentation, simply run it.


Web interface installation and usage instructions
-------------------------------------------------
To use phpDocumentor as a web interface, you need to install a Web server
and configure it, as well as install PHP version 4.1.0 or greater.  Consult
the documentation of your webserver and of PHP for installation support.

Windows and Unix
----------------
Open a web browser and browse to index.html at the location that you set up.
Instructions are in the web interface.
