PhpDocumentor Version 0.2.5
################################################################################
################################################################################

The focus of this release was mainly bug fixes and new features for handling the 
which files phpdoc will parse.

hidden directories and files and now ignored by default, there is a command line
option for changing this behavior if needed

files not to parse can be specified
directories not to parse can be specified
Both of these options only work in php 4.0.5 or greater, but everything should
still work with 4.0.2 or greater, php version 4.0.5 or greater is recommened
for this verision

The template directory can now be changed allowing for custom templates to be
used without overwriting files in the templates/default directory

Not all of these options are available through the web-interface, though it was
updated to allow files and directories to be ignored to be specified

This will be the last 0.2.x release that contains new features, the new 0.3.x
series will contain new features that i have been putting off, including:
	XML output
	Default HTML template that makes more use of css and html4 complaint
	Alternate HTML template similar to Ulf Wendel's phpdoc
	Clean up of template class to allow for new features
	Autogeneration of web interface so that it keeps upto date with cli
	A web and php-gtk based class browser that uses the xml output files
	A test framework to use for regression and bug testing
