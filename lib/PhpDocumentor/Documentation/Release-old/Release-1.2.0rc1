The phpDocumentor team would like to announce the release of phpDocumentor
1.2.0 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1.  All features that will be present in the final
release of 1.2.0 have been implemented, and all known bugs fixed.  This release
is only intended to ensure that all bugs have been fixed before the big release.

The structure of the {@source} tag has changed slightly in this release.  See
the documentation of inline {@source} for details

for PEAR users, the new --pear command-line switch will be a boon.  Leave it on
by default if your package follows PEAR coding and directory naming standards

The peardoc2 converter has been moved to an extension of the DocBook converter,
to use, the command-line has changed from XML:DocBook:peardoc2 to
XML:DocBook/peardoc2:default.

------
IMPORTANT: phpDocumentor 1.2.0rc1 requires PHP version 4.1.0 or greater.
phpDocumentor will function best with PHP version 4.3.0 or greater, as it will
use of the tokenizer extension if php 4.3.0 is installed for a tremendous
increase in parsing speed.
------

phpDocumentor is a JavaDoc-like automatic documentation generator for PHP
written in PHP.  It is the most versatile tool for documenting PHP.

Once again, phpDocumentor brings a great increase in usability with the 1.2
branch.  The addition of a tokenizer-based parser increases parsing speed by
up to 4 times (that's 400% faster) compared to previous versions.  In addition,
scalability has been improved, allowing generation of documents in multiple
output formats with one command.  The usage of config files makes repetitive
parsing tasks straightforward and reduces the chance for error.

The addition of DocBlock templates, extended documentation (tutorials) parsing,
and many other new features make this release the most useful automatic
documentor for any programming language.

The default HTML Converter has been ported to a new Smarty-based converter,
HTMLframesConverter, and all of the old templates have been ported to the new
Smarty-based format.  The HTMLdefaultConverter has been deprecated since its
functionality is redundant.  Due to the time it takes to convert a template to
the new format, the phpDocumentor team extends an offer to do this conversion
for anyone who has a brand new template.  We may also include the template in a
future release, if permission is granted.

Due to interest from PEAR programmers, there is a new beta-quality XML:DocBook
converter with peardoc2 templates.  This converter could also generate other
DocBook formats, if desired, but does not generate indexing for this release.

The PDF Converter has stepped up to beta-quality, is fully templatable, and
has most bugs completely fixed.  The CHM converter has also taken major strides
and is close to beta quality.

As predicted, the Smarty template engine is the primary template engine for
all converters.

For users new to phpDocumentor, phpDocumentor uses an event-driven parser
and intermediary data structures that allow it to perform at a level other
automatic documentors for PHP cannot achieve:
  --parsing any php file, with multiple classes and functions in the same file
  --fully compliant with even the most esoteric php syntax 
  	($string = <<< EOF, for example)
  --ability to generate multiple output formats
  --extremely fast parsing
  --error/warnings by line number and file to allow for debugging of
	documentation tags
  --multiple output templates to easily customize the look of generated
	documentation
  --extensive documentation of the package, including a detailed specification
	for tags and the included template engine
  --open source, GPL
  

A full listing of all closed bugs and feature requests can be found in the 
next section of the notes

phpDocumentor 1.2.0rc1 is nearly ready for production use documenting any PHP
project, download it and try the most advanced solution for PHP documentation
today to help us find the last hidden bugs.
