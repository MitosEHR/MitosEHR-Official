The phpDocumentor team would like to announce the release of phpDocumentor
1.1.0 FINAL.  This release has all known bugs fixed and all 
new features implemented.

IMPORTANT: phpDocumentor 1.1.0 FINAL requires PHP version 4.1.0 or greater. Previous
versions, including the release candidate 2 required 4.0.6 or greater.  Please upgrade
if you are using 4.0.6, phpDocumentor will not work properly.

phpDocumentor is a JavaDoc-like automatic documentation generator for PHP
written in PHP.  It is the most versatile tool for documenting PHP.

This version brings a new level of stability and speed to automatic
documentation of PHP code.  Fully 25% faster than version 1.0, this version
features new abilities to document global variables, static function variables,
and makes writing a Converter for other output formats much simpler.
In addition, phpDocumentor version 1.1.0 can directly document a CVS root, the first
autodocumentor to have this ability.

There are a number of new output possibilities added in rc2 have stabilized.  The new
Smarty Template Converter is fully functional.  The PDF, and CHM Converters are both
ALPHA, repeat NOT FINAL code with many bugs and problems.  These will be addressed for
the next release.

The Smarty driven output will be the default output in the 1.2 time period.

NOTE: Version 1.1.0 has a different command-line syntax using -o or --output.

For users new to phpDocumentor, phpDocumentor uses an event-driven parser
and intermediary data structures that allow it to perform at a level other
automatic documentors for PHP cannot achieve:
  --parsing any php file, with multiple classes and functions in the same file
  --fully compliant with even the most esoteric php syntax 
  	($string = <<< EOF, for example)
  --ability to generate multiple output formats
  --extremely fast parsing
  --error/warnings by line number and file to allow for debugging of
	documentation tags
  --multiple output templates to easily customize the look of generated
	documentation
  --extensive documentation of the package, including a detailed specification
	for tags and the included template engine
  --open source, GPL
  
Changes from version 1.1.0rc2 include:
  --VAST improvement in the pre-alpha PDF Converter, uses Cpdf version 0.09, no warnings (finally)
  --all known bugs are fixed in the non-alpha code.
  --major improvements to the Smarty templates
  --many bugfixes listed below
  --addition of a new template for the default HTML Converter, phphtmllib.  It only works with
    a project that has one package.  Be advised.  This template courtesy of
    Walter Boring IV (http://phphtmllib.newsblob.com/)

Changes from version 1.1.0rc1 include:
  --major improvement to the PDF Converter, it uses a pre-release of Cpdf with bookmarks
  --addition of a new, very nice HTML converter based on the Smarty template
  --addition of a new pre-alpha CHM converter (only works in windows, because it requires MS HTML Help Workshop)
  --fixes to small template bugs that affect HTMLdefaultConverter output
  --fixes to large linking bugs caused by IntermediateParser sorting introduced in 1.1
  --fix a parsing bug if a tag (not the first) has a space after its opening @ like @ param
  --fix for @param &$parameter
  --inline documentation completed for new elements and revised for old
  --added makedoc.sh, that can be used to build project documentations. More info in
  README file and inside its comments.

  
Changes from version 1.0.0 include:
  --NEW COMMAND-LINE SYNTAX -o format:convertername:template (like PDF:default:default
    or HTML:default:DOM/l0l33t)
  --fixes to rare bugs that affect very large projects with many packages
  --automatic linking to elements in any package
  --greatly improved inheritance and @package tag handling.  Procedural pages
    can now inherit the package of classes defined in them, and vice-versa.
  --addition of ProceduralPages class simplifies Converter writing immensely
  --pre-alpha PDF Converter that uses Wayne Munro's public domain Cpdf library
  --simple commandline for output: -o outputformat:convertername:templatename, so
    to use the default HTML template with the DOM/l0l33t template, use
	-o HTML:default:DOM/l0l33t.
