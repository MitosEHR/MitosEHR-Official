The phpDocumentor team would like to announce the release of phpDocumentor
1.1.0 Release Candidate 1.  This release has all known bugs fixed and all 
new features implemented.  The only thing that will be changed in the release
of 1.1.0 is the documentation, and any bugs that are in 1.1.0rc1

phpDocumentor is a JavaDoc-like automatic documentation generator for PHP
written in PHP.  It is the most versatile tool for documenting PHP.

This version brings a new level of stability and speed to automatic
documentation of PHP code.  Fully 25% faster than version 1.0, this version
features new abilities to document global variables, static function variables,
and makes writing a Converter for other output formats much simpler.
In addition, phpDocumentor version 1.1.0 can directly document a CVS root, the first
autodocumentor to have this ability.

For users new to phpDocumentor, phpDocumentor uses an event-driven parser
and intermediary data structures that allow it to perform at a level other
automatic documentors for PHP cannot achieve:
  --parsing any php file, with multiple classes and functions in the same file
  --fully compliant with even the most esoteric php syntax 
  	($string = <<< EOF, for example)
  --ability to generate multiple output formats
  --extremely fast parsing
  --error/warnings by line number and file to allow for debugging of
	documentation tags
  --multiple output templates to easily customize the look of generated
	documentation
  --extensive documentation of the package, including a detailed specification
	for tags and the included template engine
  --open source, GPL

Changes from version 1.0.0 include:
  --fixes to rare bugs that affect very large projects with many packages
  --automatic linking to elements in any package
  --greatly improved inheritance and @package tag handling.  Procedural pages
    can now inherit the package of classes defined in them, and vice-versa.
  --addition of ProceduralPages class simplifies Converter writing immensely
  --pre-alpha PDF Converter that uses Wayne Munro's public domain Cpdf library
  --simple commandline for output: -o outputformat:convertername:templatename, so
    to use the default HTML template with the DOM/l0l33t template, use
	-o HTML:default:DOM/l0l33t.

Changes from version 1.0.0rc1 include:
  --fixes to bugs with parsing extremely large projects
  --linking to defines fixed
  --new templates for dom supporting browsers that allows for 
  	minimizing/maximizing classes in the left list
  --brand new template spec in the spec/templates directory
  --better error handling, new unknown tags array in parserDocBlock for
    Converter use in custom templates
  
Changes from version 0.4.2a include:
  --resolution of many bugs
  --the addition of intermediary parsing structures that nearly double parsing speed
    and allow for new Converter class to process output
  --improved class inheritance and package handling
  --error and warning system
  --improved inline documentation and external documentation

A full listing of all closed bugs and feature requests can be found in the 
next section of the notes
