PhpDocumentor Version 0.2.6
################################################################################
################################################################################

Well I haven't got a chance to start the 0.3.x series.  But that works out the
best since a new php extension that produces xml using the zend engine as
surfaced.  At some point this will become a parser for this xml and a front-end
for running things.  At the moment the extension isn't stable but there some 
hope for having a really good parse engine built into php somewhere in the 
php 4.1.x series.

Now onto the changes in the new version.  I've got quite a bit activity from 
others in the last few months including a patch fixing the rest of the win32
directory problems by Florian Clever.  There is also a small patch added by
Gerard CANTEGRIL <CANTEGRIL_Gerard@stna.dgac.fr> that updates the web interface.

Thanks to Dennis Kehrig <TheGeek@web.de> for his new template, to use just 
add -td templates/l0l33t/ when you run phpdoc.  The template doesn't use tables 
and has a nice clean look.  Here is Dennis intro to it
	I have created an alternate template for phpDoc. Because I often used 
	<UL> and <LI> and did not use <TABLE>, I first thought of Ul-Li-Ta and 
	therefore of Lolita. And since we are computer geeks, l0l33t@ would be 
	funny, too ;) So that's the name...

Thanks to Gregory Beaver <cellog at users.sourceforge.net> for all the recent
bug filing, and patches

Keep the patchs coming its great to see improvments and bug fixes coming from
someone else.
