PhpDocumentor Version 0.4.0	The BETA Release
################################################################################
################################################################################

With this release were into the beta cycle.  All important features are there
and there shouldn't be any big bugs left.  Were of course always looking for
great new features and bug fixes, keep up the support.

Thanks to Gregory Beaver <cellog@php.net> for all his help on
making this release possible.  He will be gone until late May so development
will slow down for a bit, but don't worry 1.0 will be released before he gets 
back.

In 0.4.1 im planing on updating to template engine to somethign with a couple
more features.  This will change the basic syntax for loops and includes,
I will provide documentation so anyone who has custom templates should be able
to make a quick update to the new engine.  Also if you have a custom template
and you think others would enjoy email it to me, or post it on the SF site
and i'll include it in the main release.
