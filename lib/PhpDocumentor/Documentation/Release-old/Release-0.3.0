PhpDocumentor Version 0.3.0
################################################################################
################################################################################

This release brigns us close to being feature complete, all we need now are some
more indexes.  If anyone wants to help out, thats a good task to work on.

Now onto the changes in the new version.  This release is mainly the addition
of linking @see comments, and creating full inheirtance trees.  Showing methods
inheirited from parent class has also been added.  Howto.html has also been
updated so the documentation is much better.

Each template can have its own stylesheet.css file and it is automaticaly copied
to the output directory.  PHPDocumentor ships with 2 different templates, the
default one, which uses a table layout, and looks like JavaDoc, and non tabled
version template called l0l33t@ to use it just add -td templates/l0l33t/.

Thanks to Gregory Beaver <cellog@php.net> for writing the linking
stage, parse so @see tags work, and for updating the howto.php
