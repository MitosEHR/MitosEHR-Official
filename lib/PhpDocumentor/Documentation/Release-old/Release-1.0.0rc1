The PHPDocumentor team would like to announce the release of PHPDocumentor
v1.0 release candidate 1.  This is a stable non-beta release candidate with
all features implemented and known bugs fixed.

PHPDocumentor is a JavaDoc-like automatic documentation generator for PHP
written in PHP.  It is the most versatile tool for documenting PHP.

For users new to PHPDocumentor, PHPDocumentor uses an event-driven parser
and intermediary data structures that allow it to perform at a level other
automatic documentors for PHP cannot achieve:
  --parsing any php file, with multiple classes and functions in the same file
  --fully compliant with even the most esoteric php syntax 
  	($string = <<< EOF, for example)
  --ability to generate multiple output formats
  --extremely fast parsing
  --error/warnings by line number and file to allow for debugging of
	documentation tags
  --multiple output templates to easily customize the look of generated
	documentation
  --extensive documentation of the package, including a detailed specification
	for tags
  --open source, GPL

Changes from version 0.4.2a include:
  --resolution of many bugs
  --the addition of intermediary parsing structures that nearly double parsing speed
    and allow for new Converter class to process output
  --improved class inheritance and package handling
  --error and warning system
  --improved inline documentation and external documentation

A full listing of all closed bugs and feature requests can be found in the 
next section of the notes

PHPDocumentor is ready for immediate use documenting any PHP project,
