PhpDocumentor Version 0.2.4

First i would like to thank Juan Pablo Morales <ju-moral@uniandes.edu.co> for the
improved web interface that he wrote.  I would also like to thank Stefan Hojer 
(redcube at sf) for submitting so many bugs.  I'm sure everyone will appreciate
all the fixes that got into this release because of him.

Release 0.2.4 is mainly composed of bug fixes but it also contains one major new
feature, the @package tags and @subpackage tags are now used.  This allows you
to divide your code into groups which makes the documentation from large applications
much more usable.

I'm sorry if i didn't get the new feature you wanted added out there in this release
I've been pretty busy at my real job so i haven't been able to put the hours into 
phpdoc that I've wanted to.  If you have something you would like added to phpdoc
please file at bug report at sourceforge.  This will keep things from getting lost
and will annoy me into getting my butt in gear and adding what you want.

Also if you haven't noticed yet I'm starting to write some documentation the howto is
available at http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/howto.php

The changelog is available in the tarball, or online at http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/Changelog

You can download the newest version from http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/downloads.php

And of course you can reach the webpage at http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/ or http://phpdoc.org/
(phpdoc.org might not be back up yet, since i haven't taken the time to move stuff over to the
new server but sf has the same content)

Hope you enjoy,
