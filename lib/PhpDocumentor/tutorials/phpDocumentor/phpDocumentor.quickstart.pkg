  <title>What is phpDocumentor?  What can it do?</title>
  <para>
   phpDocumentor is a tool written in PHP designed to create complete documentation
   directly from both PHP code and external documentation.  The truth is, PHP source code
   is so lucid, it can practically serve as its own documentation.  phpDocumentor taps
   into this fact by parsing out all kinds of logical structures already found in PHP,
   such as files, classes, functions, define constants, global variables, and class
   variables/methods and organizes them into a traditional manual format.  In addition, new
   with version 1.3.0, source code elements introduced in PHP 5 (class constants,
   interfaces, and others) can also be parsed, if phpDocumentor is run through PHP 5.
   Output can be created for remote web
   browsing, print, and integration into IDE help systems through
   converters for HTML, PDF, and CHM (windows help files).
  </para>
  <para>
   phpDocumentor generates manual-format documentation by reading it from special
   PHP comments called {@tutorial phpDocumentor.howto.pkg#basics.docblock}.
   DocBlocks are where you as the author of a software project should document helpful
   information that can be used by others (or your future self) to
   determine how to use and extend your PHP package.
  </para>
  <para>
   Although the ability to add succinct documentation in the source code is essential,
   it cannot replace the importance of verbose documentation that is not
   in the source code, such as a user manual, or tutorials such as the one you
   are reading now.  If the text you see here were placed in the source code
   for phpDocumentor, it would serve little useful purpose, clutter up the code,
   and be difficult to locate.  However, the ability to hyperlink between documentation
   in the source code and external documentation is essential.  External documentation
   for function foo must be able to reference the generated in-code documentation, and
   with phpDocumentor this is finally possible.  To learn more, read about
   {@tutorial tutorials.pkg}.
  </para>

 <refsect1 id="{@id installation}">
  <title>Installation</title>
  <para>
   There are two official installation methods for phpDocumentor.  The first is through
   downloading and extracting one of the available archives downloadable through pear.php.net
   and sourceforge.net, and the other is through the PEAR installer.  There is planning for
   a {@link http://www.phing.org Phing} task and for distribution through other
   new and promising installation frameworks like the {@link http://www.zzoss.com ZZ/OSS installer}.
   However, only the two official installation methods are supported by phpDocumentor's developers.
  </para>
  <refsect2 id="{@id sf}">
   <title>Download from Pear.Php.net or Sourceforge.net</title>
   <para>
    To install phpDocumentor from a .zip or tarball downloaded directly from pear.php.net or
    sourceforge.net, first determine whether you will be using phpDocumentor's web or command-line
    interface (see the {@tutorial phpDocumentor.quickstart.pkg#basicusage} section for
    help in making this decision).
   </para>
   <para>
    If you wish to use the command-line interface, unzip the archive into any directory,
    say <screen>/home/myuser/phpdoc</screen> or <screen>C:\Program Files\phpdoc</screen>,
    and add that directory to your path statement.  To use, run the &quot;phpdoc&quot;
    command.  In windows, you will need to edit the phpdoc.bat file, and change the
    first line to the path of the CLI version of PHP (usually C:\php4\cli\php.exe by
    default).
   </para>
   <para>
    To use the web interface, you must have a web server such as Apache installed, and
    must have a working PHP sapi for that webserver.  To test, save the code below as
    phpinfo.php in your document root and browse to http://localhost/phpinfo.php
   </para>
   <para>
    phpinfo.php:
    <programlisting role="php">
    <![CDATA[
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
    ]]>
    </programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    If you see a beautiful purple display of PHP information, then your PHP setup is
    working.  To use phpDocumentor's web interface, simply unzip the archive into
    a subdirectory of your document root (such as phpdoc) and browse to that location
    (http://localhost/phpdoc).
   </para>
   <caution>
    A Javascript-enabled browser such as Netscape, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Opera, or Konqueror is
    required to view the newer web interface.  If you wish to use a non-javascript browser such as
    links/lynx, use the old web interface, phpdoc.php at http://localhost/phpdoc/phpdoc.php.
   </caution>
  </refsect2>
  <refsect2 id="{@id pear}">
   <title>Installation through {@link http://pear.php.net PEAR}</title>
   <para>
    To install phpDocumentor through PEAR, you must first have a working installation of
    PEAR.  Instructions for properly installing PEAR are located at the official
    PEAR website, {@link http://pear.php.net}.  phpDocumentor developers do not support
    installation issues with PEAR, instead seek help from PEAR developers.
   </para>
   <para>
    Installing phpDocumentor for use on the command-line is simple.  Simply run:
    <screen>
     <![CDATA[
$ pear install PhpDocumentor
    ]]>
    </screen>
    and you then have full access
    to the phpdoc command, both in windows and unix, without further configuration.
   </para>
   <para>
    To install phpDocumentor to use the web interface, you must first change one of
    PEAR's configuration variables, data_dir, to be a sub-directory of your web
    server's document root.  The simplest way to do this is through PEAR's command-line
    interface with the command:
    <screen>
    <![CDATA[
$ pear config-set data_dir /path/to/document_root/pear
    ]]>
    </screen>
   </para>
   <para>
    Configuring this value through the web interface is also simple.  Click on the
    configuration icon in the left-hand frame, and type in the path in the data_dir
    text box.
   </para>
   <para>
    Once this configuration is complete, simply install phpDocumentor as described
    in the second paragraph above, and you can then browse to 
    http://localhost/pear/PhpDocumentor to have access to the web interface.  Once
    this configuration step has been taken, there is never any need to change, and you
    can easily upgrade to future phpDocumentor versions by using pear's upgrade command.
   </para>

 <refsect1 id="{@id coding}">
  <title>How to document your code for use with phpDocumentor</title>
  <para>
   Documenting your code projects is straightforward and intuitive for the most part.
   Before you begin, you may wish to download the sample documentation project and
   try running phpDocumentor on them as you read along, found at
   {@tutorial sample1.pkg}, {@tutorial sample2.pkg}, {@tutorial sample3.pkg} or found
   bundled in the tutorials/ directory of your phpDocumentor distribution.  Before parsing,
   copy the examples to another directory.
  </para>
  <para>
   First of all, run phpDocumentor on the blank file sample1.php.  If you are using the command-line interface, run this command from the tutorials/sample directory:
  </para>
  <para>
   <screen>
    <![CDATA[
$ phpdoc -o HTML:frames:earthli -f sample1.php -t docs
    ]]>
   </screen>
  </para>
  <para>
   If you are using the web interface, click the &quot;Files&quot; tab, and type in
   the full path to <filename>tutorials/sample/sample1.php</filename>.  Then click the &quot;Output&quot;
   tab and type in the full path to <filename>tutorials/sample/docs</filename>, and finally click the
   &quot;Create&quot; button in the lower right-hand corner.
  </para>
  <para>
   With a web browser, open the newly created <filename>tutorials/sample/docs/index.html</filename> file
   and you will see the rich array of information that phpDocumentor can parse from
   the source code even without any documentation comments.  Inheritance information,
   polymorphism and constants are all recognized automatically.  Note that the only
   element that is not automatically documented is the global variable - to do this,
   you must use a phpDocumentor DocBlock as described in the next section of this
   quickstart manual.  Also note that although the include_once specifies a file
   within the include_path, phpDocumentor will not automatically parse sample2.php,
   you must manually specify the files or directories to parse.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you're feeling adventurous, experiment with the parse options available and
   parse the sample files a few times to see how they affect the documentation output.
   To find out options in the command-line interface, type
   <screen>
   <![CDATA[
$ phpdoc -h
   ]]>
   </screen>
  </para>
  <refsect2 id="{@id phpcomments}">
   <title>Documenting your PHP source code with comments</title>
   <para>
    Now open <filename>{@tutorial sample2.pkg sample2.php}</filename>.  This is the same code content as
    sample1.php, but it contains a full array of phpDocumentor DocBlock comments.
    Note that every DocBlock comment is a C-style comment with two leading asterisks
    (*), like so:
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting role="php">
/**
 *
 */
    </programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    All other comments are ignored by the documentation parser.  Note that although most
    of the documentation is plain English, there are a few &quot;@&quot; characters
    floating around the source code.  This symbol is used to pass a special command to
    the parser, and is called a tag.  If the symbol is at the beginning of a line, it
    is a standard tag, and if it is enclosed in {curly brackets}, it is an inline tag.
    You can read more about tags at {@tutorial tags.pkg} and {@tutorial inlinetags.pkg}.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting role="php">
/**
 * {@inlinetag}
 * this is @not a standardtag - must begin a line.
 * this is a valid {@inlinetag} also
 * @standardtag
 */
    </programlisting>
   </para>
   <refsect3 id="{@id global}">
    <title>Documenting global variables</title>
    <para>
     Notice this code from sample2.php:
    </para>
    <para>
     <programlisting role="php">
/**
 * Special global variable declaration DocBlock
 * @global integer $GLOBALS['_myvar']
 * @name $_myvar
 */ 
$GLOBALS['_myvar'] = 6;
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     In this segment, we can see the two important tags used for documenting global
     variables.  The {@tutorial tags.global.pkg} tag is used to tell the parser how to
     find a global variable declaration.  Without this tag, no documentation would
     be generated for $_myvar.  The @global tag can take many forms - be sure to specify
     the type and global name, with no description, or the parser will generate a warning
     and fail to document the variable.
    </para>
    <para>
     Now, parse <filename>{@tutorial sample3.pkg sample3.php}</filename> and observe the generated documentation.
     The {@tutorial tags.name.pkg} tag is used to tell the parser how the global
     variable would be referenced by a global statement in a function.
    </para>
    <para>
     <programlisting role="php">
     <![CDATA[
/**
 * @global integer this is a function-based @global tag,
 *         because the variable name is missing
 */
function someFunction()
{
    global $_myvar;
}
     ]]>
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     The @global tag here will associate the information with the declared global statements in the
     function body in the same order of their declaration.
    </para>
   </refsect3>
   <refsect3 id="{@id warnings}">
    <title>Page-level DocBlock warnings</title>
    <para>
     The single most commonly asked question about using phpDocumentor involves
     warnings about Page-level DocBlocks.  This section will answer any
     questions about this warning once and for all.
    </para>
    <para>
     phpDocumentor organizes procedural elements and classes into special groupings called
     {@tutorial phpDocumentor.howto.pkg#documenting.elements.packages packages}.
     In earlier versions of phpDocumentor, if package was not specified explicitly using
     the {@tutorial tags.package.pkg} tag, the program would make an educated guess
     as to which package a source element belongs to.
    </para>
    <para>
     Over time, it became apparent that in many cases, source elements were incorrectly
     grouped into a package due to the guesswork phpDocumentor uses.  Finally, the decision
     was made to require an explicit @package tag, and to raise a warning any time this
     tag was missing from a top-level source element.
    </para>
    <para>
     The greatest confusion comes from the documenting of files.  phpDocumentor documents all
     source elements by reading the DocBlock that immediately precedes the element, like so:
    </para>
    <para>
     <programlisting role="php">
     <![CDATA[
<?php
/**
 * Documents the class following
 * @package SomePackage
 */
class SomeClass {
}
?>
     ]]>
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     phpDocumentor also can document the contents of a file.  But how can a DocBlock immediately precede
     the file that contains it?  The easy answer is to assume the first DocBlock in a file documents the
     file that contains it, and this works well, but can be deceptive:
    </para>
    <para>
     <programlisting role="php">
     <![CDATA[
<?php
/**
 * Documents the class following or the file?
 * @package SomePackage
 */
class SomeClass {
}
?>
     ]]>
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     The same example shows the ambiguity - does this DocBlock document the class, or the file?  To resolve
     this ambiguity, phpDocumentor uses a simple algorithm to make its decision.
     <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        If the first DocBlock in a file contains a @package tag, it documents the file unless it
        precedes a class declaration
       </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        If the first DocBlock in a file precedes another DocBlock, it documents the file
       </simpara>
      </listitem>
     </orderedlist>

   <title>Writing external documentation and linking to source code documentation</title>
   <para>
    Although documentation parsed directly from source code is tremendously useful, it cannot stand on its own.
    In addition, truly useful in-code documentation must be succinct enough so that the code is not completely
    obscured by the documentation.  External documentation is a must for a complete documentation solution.
    However, external documentation must be able to link to API source documentation to be useful.  With a
    constantly changing API documentation, it is very easy for external documentation to become out of date.
    In addition, external documentation must be in a format that can be converted into other formats such as
    HTML, PDF and XML.
   </para>
   <para>
    phpDocumentor provides a simple and elegant solution to all of these problems.  External
    documentation in DocBook format can be easily converted to other formats.  Using inline
    tags, phpDocumentor can generate a consistent manual in many different formats by combining
    the output from parsing the source and parsing external documentation.  The words you read at this
    moment are in a DocBook-based file located in tutorials/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor.quickstart.pkg
