\-Source \-Code \-Highlighting

\-The classes in this file are responsible for the dynamic $<$programlisting role=\char`\"{}tutorial\char`\"{}$>$ tags output. \-Using the \hyperlink{class_word_parser}{\-Word\-Parser}, the \hyperlink{classphp_documentor___tutorial_highlight_parser}{php\-Documentor\-\_\-\-Tutorial\-Highlight\-Parser} retrieves \-P\-H\-P tokens one by one from the array generated by \hyperlink{class_word_parser}{\-Word\-Parser} source retrieval functions and then highlights them individually.

\-It accomplishes this highlighting through the assistance of methods in the output \hyperlink{class_converter}{\-Converter} passed to its parse() method, and then returns the fully highlighted source as a string
